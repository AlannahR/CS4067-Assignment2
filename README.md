Assignment 2: Effective usage of Narrative and Story Structure in a Game


Instructions:

For this assignment you (as a group) are required to prepare and deliver a 15 minute presentation in which you outline an analysis of the story structure and narrative design of a particular video game. We will cover a number of techniques and devices commonly used to create immersion stories, and manage narrative (pacing, sequencing of events, etc.) in the lectures and you are required to reference those when discussing this. Please note that it is also important that you contextualize your discussions in terms of games, i.e. how does the structure/device operate in the game, as opposed to a more traditional presentational media like a book or film? 

NOTE: I want to make sure that the same game is not discussed by more than one group so please email me to confirm your choice as soon as possible. I will operate a "first come, first served" on this so please don't assume your choice is available until I confirm.

Some points to note:

Your presentation needs to be clear, precise and delivered within time limit
All group members are expected to contribute during presentation
Each group should record their presentation and submit a link where I can download the recording as part of their submission (please include link as using inline or in one of the documents attached to your submission)
Marks shall be awarded based of both the content of your slides and the quality of the presentation delivery
Please ensure that you include "talking points" for each slide. This is essentially a script that will used when you are delivering the presentation. Please note I do not expect a word for word script, just a list of primary points that you want to make for each slide presented. This can be included as speaker notes if using PowerPoint or as a separate file (.pdf or .docx)
